    <p class="text">There are so many reasons to join a book club beyond simply reading and discussing books. You’ll broaden your horizons
    as you’re introduced to titles you may have never picked up otherwise. You’ll have a chance to hear and discuss
    viewpoints different than your own. You’ll meet new people who share your interests, and it’s a fairly inexpensive way
    to hang out with them (as long as the meetups don’t evolve into elaborate dinner parties).</p>

    <h2 class="paragraph-title"> The benefits of book club </h2>
    <h3 class="bullet-point"> I. You read books you wouldn’t normally pick up.</h3>
    <p class="text">Contrary to popular belief, people will judge a book by its cover. Or its blurb. When everyone is suggesting books, you
    end up reading books you’d not have read if the choice was yours. You might not like some of them. But you might love
    others. And when a book surprises you like that, it can quickly earn a place among your favourites.</p>
    <h3 class="bullet-point">II. You learn how other readers think, which makes your own reading better.</h3>
    <p class="text">Book club is a window. You get to see what other people learn from a book. The more this happens, the richer the story
    gets. Suddenly you’re getting inspired from a book in more ways than one because you’ve been taught how to see things
    from lots of perspectives.</p>
    <h3 class="bullet-point">III. Your knowledge gets a massive boost.</h3>
    <p class="text">Let’s assume that before joining a book club, you’d read a book a month for 10 years. That’s a grand total of 120 books.
    Now add another 20 readers. That figure launches to 2400. All that learning is yours to tap into.
    
    And that’s just from the books. What about all the experience people bring to the table as well? Reading is all about
    lifelong learning. And all that knowledge is up for grabs every time you open a book to talk about it.</p>
    <h3 class="bullet-point">IV. You get time back to read more.</h3>
    <p class="text">There’s solidarity in reading together. And discussing the book keeps you on track.
    I thought that I’d miss out on all the books I wanted to read. But it was the opposite. I read more. Book club helps you
    to reprioritise. It shocked me just how much I spent time on my phone, or sat watching a TV show I’m not really
    following. Few of us like a deadline, but the structure helped me get some of my time back.</p>
<h3 class="bullet-point"> V. You read more than what’s just advertised at the shop</h3>
<p class="text" id="end-paragraph">Before starting at a book club, I didn’t know that Roald Dahl wrote adult fiction. Another perk to reading together is
you come across lesser known books. Not just the ones on display at the train station.
